# IDS 706 Week 2 Mini-Project
This repo uses the python template generated in Week 1 to employ a pandas script that provides descriptive statistics and data visualization. The script main.py contains two functions, one of which computes and displays descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of a data column of interest, and the other of which generates a histogram of the data. The script test_main.py tests to ensure that the descriptive statistics are computed as expected.

The specific data set used in this project is a simple one; it contains all Robert De Niro movies and their corresponding Rotten Tomatoes scores. The data of interest are the scores themselves. 

I have included a pdf report in the repo that summarises the descriptive statistics of interest and displays the visualization.
